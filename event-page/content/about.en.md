### A Historic Hackathon Originating from Silicon Valley

With its origins in the release of the iPhone in 2007, it has a long history of 16 years.
Starting with iPhoneDevCamp (2007, 2008, 2009), it expanded in scale and participants to iPadDevCamp (2010) and iOSDevCamp (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013).

### Event Format

Detailed Format: https://visiondevcamp.org/hackathon/

The event format has evolved over the years from its origins in iOSDevCamp.
What is different about this Hackathon vs other large events like MIT Reality Hack:

-   Focus is on collaboration!
-   Less emphasis on expertise ... other hackathons you have to qualify to join or be invited.
-   Being learner/beginner friendly, this hackathon offers in-event learning sessions
-   Competitition Judging categories are flexible. Judges reserve the right to create new categories if they see something worth an award.
-   Participants can have a team size of 1-6, solo teams are fine, large teams are discouraged
-   Teams formation encourages people to work with new people, mix skills
-   Staff will support team formation, and work hard to make sure participants have a team if they desire
-   Participants are invited to join multiple teams
-   Teams are invited to support each other ... instead of intensive competition, Teams are allowed to share code or knowledge
-   Winners will enjoy social media validation and publicity
-   Small prizes are to be awarded after Judging
-   Hardware will be made available for participants (to share) during the event
