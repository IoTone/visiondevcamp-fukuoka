- **Category**: WebXR Award
- **Prize**: ¥2,000 Amazon Gift Card
- **Project**: PinchVR101
- **Developer**: Yuya Shimbori
- **Code**: https://github.com/yuyays/three_js
- **Technology**: Three.js / WebXR

Despite being his first XR development and his first time using Apple Vision Pro, he successfully implemented both-hand tracking and two-handed object grabbing. He achieved this challenging goal and plans to further evolve the experience for greater immersion.

By profession, he is a computer programming instructor, inspiring people in educational settings through technology and creativity. His achievement reflects his passion and inquisitiveness as an educator and will motivate many. He received the WebXR Prize from the Fukuoka judges.

#### #2 Planetarium

Jorge, who normally conducts mathematical research, leveraged insights from the event workshop to create Planetarium. By touching the sphere, it stops or changes color—features built upon the workshop’s code with his own creative touches. He shared many ideas and inspired fellow participants. His project was truly impressive.

#### #3 Flying Debug

- **Category**: Immersive Prize
- **Prize**: ¥1,000 Starbucks Card (×2)
- **Project**: Flying Debug
- **Members**: Charles B and Jenny Liu
- **Code**: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#72RPJA#195
- **Technology**: Babylon.js / WebXR

This team formed on the second day. Jenny, undecided on a project, wanted to apply her web development experience, while Charles had an idea for visually presenting notes in XR space tied to Oblivion (a note-taking platform).

During development, they encountered technical issues and pivoted boldly. Discovering Apple Vision Pro’s support for Babylon.js, they shifted from note visualization to an immersive city-scale experience. Users can teleport between two distinct worlds within a wireframe landscape.

Executing such a pivot requires flexibility and not clinging to initial ideas. The team alternated between development and testing, and by Sunday, they confirmed functionality on Apple Vision Pro. Though initially challenging, they resolved issues through calm adjustments.

Their final hurdle was the live demo: a last-minute glitch threatened their presentation, but through perseverance, they overcame it and delivered a polished showcase. We look forward to them revisiting their XR note visualization concept in the future.

#### #4 INARI (In NARratIve)

- **Category**: Overall Engineer Cafe Prize
- **Prize**: Grand Prize (details forthcoming)
- **Project**: INARI (In NARratIve)
- **Developer**: Tung Tran
- **Code**: N/A
- **Technology**: Swift, RealityKit, MidJourney, Gemini, gTTS

A PhD student at Kyushu University, he approached the event fully prepared. Despite no formal experience with Apple Vision Pro or XR, he swiftly developed a clear plan to create AI-driven narrative experiences that impressed all.

The demo’s goal was to generate immersive 3D spaces in real time based on story or book content.

The biggest challenge arose on Saturday night. While attempting to dynamically load environments via generative AI services, he faced numerous difficulties but triumphed through determination. With no prior SwiftUI experience, his persistence deserves high praise. He ultimately delivered a semi-interactive environment with scene transitions.

An added touch in the demo: externally loaded audio allowed the audience to experience Don Quixote’s narration within the generated world. The pipeline he built left everyone in awe.

He was awarded the Engineer Cafe Prize by its founder. We anticipate his continued advancement in real-time immersive Apple Vision Pro experiences from any story content.

#### #5 Training Partner

- **Category**: Team Prize
- **Prize**: ¥2,000 Gift Card ×2
- **Project**: Training Partner
- **Members**: Shinnosuke Eguchi, Mr. Hirayama
- **Code**: https://github.com/kanakonagiri/vdv2025-body-teacher
- **Demo**: https://gyazo.com/dc437ec86b6538bde956d6de789a1e9
- **Technology**: SwiftUI, Reality Composer, Vibe Coding, Adobe Model Marketplace

Formed after the first night, this team aimed to create a VR boxing training partner. Neither member had 3D development experience, and both used Apple Vision Pro for the first time. One member was not a programmer but a project manager. Despite the technical challenge, they remained committed through the weekend.

Their first hurdle was starting from zero experience. They adopted “Vibe Coding,” learning AVP, Swift, and RealityKit by hands-on experimentation. They imported 3D models from Adobe into Reality Composer and implemented them in RealityKit. By Saturday, they succeeded in animating a model in AR. The working training partner experience was highly engaging.

On demo day, their presentation skills stood out. They communicated technical achievements and the project’s future potential, garnering significant interest. This concept holds promise as an athlete training tool. We strongly encourage further development of this vision.

#### #6 BlockCatch

- **Category**: Unity PolySpatial Prize
- **Prize**: ¥5,000 Gift Certificate
- **Project**: BlockCatch
- **Developer**: Yuichi Shimamura
- **Demo**: https://block2024.glitch.me/
- **Technology**: Unity 5 PolySpatial

Twelve-year-old Yuichi participated solo and focused intently on building something fun. Adults approached him, thinking he needed help, but he balanced seeking assistance with solving issues independently.

Just before the presentation, he hesitated, saying, “It’s not perfect yet, so I don’t want to submit.” We persuaded him, and the project was entered. He confidently demonstrated a juggling app on Apple Vision Pro, built without formal training. The audience was filled with surprise and admiration.

We eagerly anticipate his future achievements.

#### #7 Nearling

- **Category**: IoTone Japan “Systems Prize”
- **Prize**: Solar Charger for AVP + ESP32-CAM
- **Project**: Nearling
- **Developer**: Keizo Nagamine
- **Demo**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_0w5yHBVlevxnsqAzeic0Q8rsVJglLx/view
- **Technology**: Native RealityKit, 3D Modeling, iPad Camera/Computer Vision App

Developed by an Apple Vision Pro–savvy developer, this project integrated multiple devices—camera, iPad, Apple Vision Pro—into a local-only system without cloud.

The concept is to foster a connection with their soon-to-be-born child via AR. The AR screen in Apple Vision Pro displays real-time visuals of the child’s status. Although rooted in personal sentiment, the implementation is highly refined, skillfully integrating real-time video visualization and network linkage.

Sunday’s demo featured a thoughtful presentation with props and slides, and the system ran stably, leaving a strong impression. Completing such a complex configuration within a weekend is a remarkable achievement.
