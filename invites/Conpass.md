# What is VisionDevCamp?

It is the era of Spatial Computing, pioneered by the Apple VisionPro.  Come hack on a project with a team or solo, and create new spacial experiences in a Hackathon format.  No experience is needed.  Calling all Designers, Unity Devs, Digital Artists, AI experts, Mobile App Devs, Web Devs, Story Tellers, and Startup Entrepreneurs.  Devices for hacking will be available.

VisionDevCamp has its roots in a hackathon that first started in 2007 in the Silicon Valley with the release of the iPhone, the iPhoneDevCamp.   Since then iPhoneDevCamp expaned to iPadDevCamp and iOSDevCamp.  These hackathons have a long history. The payments company Square, Apple's Testflight tool and the OAuth protocol were all originally started at a DevCamp hackathon.  This is the first time such a prestigious event has come to Japan

This is a free event, but registration is required.  We strongly recommend you attend the Friday evening session to understand the format and possibly make a team.  We encourage in person attendance and collaboration between teams.  We have some Spatial Design experts, Native Swift Development, Story Telling/Narrative Experts, and Startup entrepreneurs there to share experiences.

Don't have ideas for what to hack for a project?  It's ok, we will post ideas, and even offer "bounty" rewards for specific project ideas.

## Event Format

This is a "learning" hackathon, where collaboration and producing an app for VisionPro.  Unlike other hackathons, our focus is less on "the competition" and more on generating a viable idea.  It is often said that in Japan, it is hard to go from 0 to 1.  We will help teams break the mold on this idea, and show the design process from 0 to 1, and possibly for some teams to consider launching their ideas.  We have available our Silicon Valley network to offer post event, and several sponsors will be cross promoting the results.  

What we do differently:

-  no OSS code required.  Some hackathons require you to give up your intellectual property in order to compete.   Not required.  We ask everyone to follow a code of honor and represent their code as unique and original, and reference dependencies that are used.  No commercial code please!
-  Team size can be solo or up to 6 people 
-  People can participate on multiple teams
-  While this is a VisionPro event, we welcome other ecosystems like XR, and it is possible to develop for AVP from an XR perspective and will judge  according to design and use of spatial computing
-  We encourage team members to support each other across teams.  In true Silicon Valley spirit, open collaboration leads to greater results.
-  We provide devices for the event, through our sponsor Styly.  We will ask teams to checkout devices in one hour blocks and ensure that we can successfully share devices among teams. 
-  Our event is simultaneously happening in Tokyo and we will have opportunities throughout the weekend for people to learn, through talks and conversations by event speakers. 
-  Competition Categories: We will award both "judges choice" awards and winners for set categories.  We have technical and non-technical categories.   A full list of categories can be found on the event website.
-  Prizes: we don't have a big purse to give away.  This is a non-profit event.  However, we will provide some monetary prizes (gift cards)
